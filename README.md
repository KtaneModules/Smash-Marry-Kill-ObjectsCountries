# Smash, Marry, Kill

Idea by Lord Kabewmâ„¢.

## To Do

* Deal with more than one of the same module (Categorized once, category appears as many times as there are that module) (DONE)
* Strike when modules are solved before categorization is finished (Remove from possibilities variable) (DONE)
* If Mystery Module is present, remove module hidden by Mystery Module only once (in case it appears multiple times) (DONE)
* If Organization is present, find module given by Organization, always show category of that module (DONE)
* If other Smash, Marry, Kills are present, synchronize all input and output (DONE)
* Remove entries based on solved modules regardless of if they were actually supposed to be solved (DONE)

## Checklist

### Categorization

* All other mods ignored
* Multiple of 3 non-ignored mods (one of each)
  * Solve appropriately
  * Solve incorrectly
* Multiple of 3 unique non-ignored mods (more than one of some)
* Fewer than 3 mods
* More than 3 mods, and mods % 3 = 2
* More than 3 mods, and mods % 3 = 1
* Solving everything before categorization

### After Categorization

* Ensure softlock doesn't occur (e.g. solve all KILL modules before declaring, make sure only SMASH and MARRY appear)

### Other Bosses

* Cooperate w/ Organization
* Don't show module under Mystery Module unless it occurs more than once
* Try w/ both

### Multiple SMKs

* All of the above with multiple SMKs
