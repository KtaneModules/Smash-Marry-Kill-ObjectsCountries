# Smash, Marry, Kill

Idea by Lord Kabewmâ„¢.

## To Do

* Deal with more than one of the same module (Categorized once, category appears as many times as there are that module)
* If Mystery Module is present, remove module hidden by Mystery Module only once (in case it appears multiple times)
* If Organization is present, find module given by Organization, always show category of that module
* If other Smash, Marry, Kills are present, synchronize all input and output
* Remove entries based on solved modules regardless of if they were actually supposed to be solved
